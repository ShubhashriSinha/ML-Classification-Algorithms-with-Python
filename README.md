INSTRUCTIONS

Now that you have been equipped with the skills to use different Machine Learning algorithms, over the course of five weeks, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply it on a dataset. In this project, you will complete a notebook where you will build a classifier to predict whether a loan case will be paid off or not. 

You load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. You are expected to use the following algorithms to build your models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass
