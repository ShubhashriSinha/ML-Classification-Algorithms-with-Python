load a historical dataset from previous loan applications, clean the data, and apply different classification algorithm on the data. used following algorithms to build models:

k-Nearest Neighbour
Decision Tree
Support Vector Machine
Logistic Regression
The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable:

Jaccard index
F1-score
LogLoass
